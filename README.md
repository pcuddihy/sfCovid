# How COVID-19 Affected San Francisco 

## Background and Motivation

Iâ€™m interested in seeing the breakdown of COVID-19 in San Francisco because I think that San Francisco is a city that still has a lot of inequality and disparity between its people. It has some of the richest people in the world, as well as a massive population of homeless people. It also has a wide diversity of people across age, race, and neighborhood lines. The goal of this project is to show how those groups have been affected by COVID-19, to highlight the most affected groups.
